# USING LIST
# list has a few shortcomings. The biggest issue is that it can run into speed issue as it grows.
# The items in list are stored next to each other in memory, if the stack grows bigger than the block of memory
# that currently hold it, then Python needs to do some memory allocations. This can lead to some append() calls taking much
# longer than other ones.


# collections.deque
 Deque is preferred over list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations from both the ends
 of the container, as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which provides O(n)
 time complexity.

 # Another is Queue module, which is generally used with multiprocessing and threading
