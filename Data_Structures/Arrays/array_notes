# An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

For example, an array of 10 32-bit (4 bytes) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9,
may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ... 2036,
so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i Ã— 4)

# To DO
1.) how array is stored in memory
2.) how dynamic array works
