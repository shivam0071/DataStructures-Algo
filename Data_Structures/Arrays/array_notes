TIPS FOR QUESTION SOLVING

1.) When you want to append something to  the left side of the list, use a deque
collections.deque() and use its appendleft() method

2.) COLLECTIONS.COUNTER
a = collections.Counter("cool")
a = {"c":1,"o":2,"l":1}
If you are using counter sometimes you might need to create a list using the about dictionary, in an expanded form for that
use:
list(a.elements())
[c,o,o,l]

# Music - Mortified
# An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

For example, an array of 10 32-bit (4 bytes) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9,
may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ... 2036,
so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i Ã— 4)

# To DO
1.) how array is stored in memory - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-ht2AKyH4

* code is stored in memory -- separate space

* global variables are stored in memory -- separate space

* functions and its local variables are stored in stack
eg - main(), demo() , test() and the scope of their local variable can't be changes
Stack size is defined by OS and compiler and excessive use might leads to stackoverflow

* Dynamic Memory allocation is done using heap memory (not DS)
Heap is simply a free pool of memory[as large as max size of memory]
in C, C++..variables on the heap stays as long as the program runs
We need to manually clean the heap using free or delete


2.) how dynamic array works -
