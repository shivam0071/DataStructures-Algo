TCP/IP (5 layers)

Physical Layer (10 Base T, 802.11 )
->
Data Link Layer ( Ethernet , Wifi )
->
Network Layer (IP) ( For routing ..how to reach from A to B)
->
Transport Layer (TCP/UDP) .. Where app to send to...Fb data to Fb and gmail data to gmail
->
Application Layer  (HTTP, SMTP) ( Where data gets displayed )


1.) CABLES

Two types of cables:-
    1.) Copper Cables[Uses Electrical Voltages to transmit data]
    (cat5(Older), cat5e, cat6) (category) twisted pairs inside the cables determine the type and speed with
    which the data is transferred
    2.) Fiber Cables [Uses pulse of light to transmit data]- Costly

2.) Hubs and Switches
    Hub is "physical layer device" that allows for connections from many computers at once
    A hub causes a
    "Collision Domain" :  A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time
    Thats why its not used today....


    Network Switch (Data Link Layer Device):
    It can inspect the data of the ethernet protocol data and then knows where to send the data hence reduces a collison domains


Hubs and switches are the primary devices used to connect computers on a single network usually referred to as LAN
but what if we want to send the data to the computers on the other computers on a different network...The ans is

ROUTERS [Network Layer] : A device that knows how to forward data between independent networks
It can inspect network layer data (IP) to decide where to send the data

The main job of the router is to take the data present inside one network and feed it to the ISP
now the ISP takes this data and another router works from here.

this is the backbone of the Internet

This ISP routers now have to make a lot of decision on how to send the data, paths etc

These routers are connected to many other routers and they communicate via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
using BGP - Routers share data with each other via this protocol which lets them learn about the most optimal
paths to forward traffic



* SERVERS and CLIENTS

Any node can either be server or client or BOTH


1.) THE PHYSICAL LAYER
    Its main aim is to move 1s and 0s from one end of the link to the next

    the way the data is transmitted is by modulation
    Modulation is a way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable

    The CN version of this is Line Coding

    SENDER --->  Digital Data (0101010111010000110) ---> ENCODER ---||----|| ----||--- DECODER(0101010111010000110) ----- RECEIVER

    10 billion 1s and 0s get transmitted every second
